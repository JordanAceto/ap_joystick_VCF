## Joystick controlled analog filter

### Features:
- SSM2164 stlye lowpass filter
    - 4-pole, 2-pole, and bandpass outputs available
- distortion either pre or post filter
- LFO with triange, square, and sample-and-hold waveforms
- envelope follower
- XY joystick controls VCF frequency and resonance

### Notes:
- this is an old project that I built on pad-per-hole prototyping board. There is no PCB layout.
- I would probably do a few things differently today, but it does work well and sounds good.
- there are a few missing values, and some that I had to guess about, it's probably pretty close to right, but there might be some errors.
- the part numbers don't necessarily match anything, for example the opamp packages may not be paired up as shown in the schematic, I would need to get my hands back on the device to check this.
